# oop-sorting-algorithms
This program takes in a text file of different shapes and sorts them using different sorting alogrithms.
You can choose to compare by either Volume or Base Area(input 'v' for volume, or 'a' for area)
The different shapes are Cylinder, Cone, Pyramid, Square Prism, Triangular Prism, Pentagonal Prism and Octagonal Prism.
There are 6 different sorting algorithms- Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Inssertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Gnome Sort.
(input 'b' for bubble, 's' for selection, 'i' for insertion, 'm' for merge, 'q' for quick, 'z' for gnome)
The program then sorts by the selected value and uses the sorting algorithm you chose and tells you how long the sort took.
